# Welcom to **Auto_doc**

This repository is not the cleanest I ever done, but it is very use full

# Presentation

The goal of this code is to create a pre-filled template for every sepcific function.
It only need the definition sentence (wich can be split in diffrents lines)

# Details

Maybe it's not the most recommended thing, but I used some type allias to make my docs more clear :

| Type             | Type allias |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| pandas.DataFrame | DataFrame   |
| numpy.ndarray    | Array       |
